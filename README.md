## Information extraction from text data

This is a text mining project to extract and clean up important information from the text such as product properties in order to unify and clean the formatting. There are many random varations of each property, for example, 
the dimensions of a product have the measuring units attached or not attached to the values, the sets have tlg. teilig. and other variations of the word, and so on. We separate them into relevant columns and then clean them up
to then reuse them for further text generation.
